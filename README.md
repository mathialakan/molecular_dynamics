# Milestones

## Day 0
### Introduction to GNU/Linux, Fortran, Github, and LaTeX. 
* Register for an account on [Github](https://www.github.com)
* Login to the HPC computing platform, clone the [ICCP/coding notes](https://github.com/ICCP/coding-notes) repository, and compile the example code
* Fork the [ICCP/ising](https://github.com/ICCP/ising) repository with your github account. Clone your fork to the HPC and/or your local computer.

## Milestone 1
* Lay out program
  * Write up the physics as you understand it in a LaTeX document (to eventually become a paper)
  * Determine figures-of-interest to include in final report
* Implement the 2D square Ising model for a constant temperature
  * Commit regularly and push changes to your fork!

## Milestone 2
* Refine the model with periodic boundary conditions, varied initial conditions
* Implement a sweep through a temperature range to determine the critical Curie temperature
  * Average several equilibrium systems at each temperature to better your statistics
* Begin collecting data

## Milestone 3
* Finalize data collection
* Write and typeset a short report with your results, making use of your initial layout
* Submit assignment by creating a pull request on the original [ICCP/ising](https://github.com/ICCP/ising) repository
